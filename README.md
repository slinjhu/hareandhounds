Hare and Hounds Game Web App
=================

This repository contains a small game called "Hare and Hounds". For more details refer to: http://pl.cs.jhu.edu/oose/assignments/assignment1.shtml

Setup
-----

It depends only on Java 8 and Maven to build and run.

Usage
-----

The code should be directly importable as an existing Maven project into Eclipse or IntelliJ, and should directly build and run from within the IDE.  You need to set up a run configuration to run <tt>Bootstrap.main()</tt>.

If you instead want to compile and run from the command line, assuming you have the Maven command line installed:

```console
mvn package
java -jar target/hareandhounds-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

Now simply point your browser to http://localhost:8080 to use the application.
