Game of Hare and Hounds
=================

This is my Assignment 1 for OOSE at JHU. A java API server is built to work with a board game frontend written in angular.js. In the game, there are three hounds and one hare. Hare tries to escape while hounds try to trap it. For more details refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare_games

Setup
-----

It depends only on Java 8 and Maven to build and run.

Usage
-----

The code should be directly importable as an existing Maven project into Eclipse or IntelliJ, and should directly build and run from within the IDE. 

If you instead want to compile and run from the command line, assuming you have the Maven command line installed:

```console
cd your/path/to/hareandhounds
mvn package
java -jar target/hareandhounds-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar 
```

Now simply point your browser to http://localhost:8080 to use the application.
